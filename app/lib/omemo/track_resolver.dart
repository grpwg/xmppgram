// Deciding which track a message goes out on (docs/10 §4).
//
// The rule this file exists to enforce: the *client* picks the track, and the
// program's only job is to say whether that choice can be carried out. It
// never silently substitutes a different one.
//
// Automatic fallback is not a convenience. Every substitution is a decision
// the user did not make, taken on their behalf, in the one place where
// getting it wrong is silent — the message still goes out, it just goes out
// readable. So:
//   * PQ unavailable      -> do not send. Report, offer OM.
//   * OMEMO unavailable   -> do not send. Report, offer NO.
//   * NO chosen           -> send, having warned.
//
// The last one looks inconsistent. It is not: refusing to send plaintext is
// the client overruling a decision the user was warned about, which is the
// same objection as refusing to send PQ. The difference is that the user
// knows what NO means and chose it anyway, whereas a silent downgrade to NO
// tells them nothing and cannot be consented to.
