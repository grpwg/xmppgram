// Group chats, end to end over a real service.
//
// Two clients on one account, joining the same room with different
// nicknames. That is the smallest shape that proves the whole path: if it works
// here, then a room with two people on two accounts works too, because nothing
// in the protocol changes — only who the second session belongs to.
//
// What it asserts, in order of how badly it would hurt to be wrong:
//
//   1. Both are listed as occupants. Without this every message assertion below
//      is meaningless: a client that is not in the room cannot send to it.
//   2. A message from one reaches the other, attributed to a **nick** and not
//      to a room address.
//   3. The room message went to `room@server/nick`, which is the address that
//      actually delivers. Sent to the bare room the server accepts it and
//      delivers it to nobody, so this is the assertion that catches the most
//      common MUC bug — and the one that fails silently in production.
