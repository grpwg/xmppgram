// Forwarding a message to another conversation.
//
// Why this does not use XEP-0297's `<forwarded/>` wrapper, which exists
// precisely for this and which moxxmpp can parse and build:
//
//   A wrapped stanza carries the *original* encryption. Its payload was
//   encrypted to the original recipient's keys, so wrapping it and sending it
//   to a third party hands that third party a ciphertext they cannot open —
//   and the wrapper's metadata still names the original recipient, which tells
//   the new one who they were talking to.
//
//   That is not a cosmetic difference. Forwarding by reuse would mean the
//   forward either fails silently or leaks who else was in the conversation.
//
// So a forward is a **new message**, re-encrypted for the new recipient on the
// new conversation's track, carrying the original's text as a `> ` quote. That
// is what every client the user knows actually does, and it composes with the
// three-track design instead of fighting it.
//
// One thing reuse would have given us and this does not: the original's
// ciphertext is not re-sent. That is correct, not a loss. The recipient of a
// forward should read what the sender chose to forward, not hold a copy of an
// encryption the sender has no reason to re-issue.
