// How much of the user's history the *server* is allowed to keep, and for how
// long (`urn:xmpp:mam:prefs:0`).
//
// This is the one setting in this client that is about somebody else's copy of
// the messages. Everything else in lib/ describes what this device may read or
// sign for; this describes what the server has been *asked* to do. Two things
// follow from that, and both are load-bearing in what follows:
//
//   1. A retention preference is an instruction, not a deletion. Nothing in
//      this protocol removes anything. Shortening retention stops the server
//      adding to what it holds; it does not empty it. A user who learns that
//      after changing the setting has been told something the setting cannot
//      deliver, so [warningsBeforeChange] says it beforehand.
//   2. A server that did not answer has not granted anything. "We do not know"
//      and "keep everything" are different states, and only one of them is a
//      permission. Every field the protocol leaves optional is optional here
//      too, and none of them defaults to the permissive reading — see the
//      comments on [MamPrefs.defaultRetention] and [MamPrefsSupport].
//
// That is the same position as `resolveTrack`, which blocks a send when the
// peer's device list cannot be read rather than treating the unreadable list
// as consent, and the same as `capabilities.dart`, which carries a `reliable`
// flag that is false when a fetch failed. Absence of evidence is never
// permission, and here it is specifically never "keep my history forever".
//
// Provenance, because the vocabulary here is wider than the standard's. The
// standardised form of this protocol (XEP-0441, in `urn:xmpp:mam:2`) carries a
// default policy plus an always/never list of JIDs, and deliberately leaves
// retention *duration* to an ad-hoc command. The dialect below adds the `max`
// day cap and the `only-muc` / `unlimited` policies. This file does not read
// one form as the other, and a policy token it does not recognise becomes an
// explicitly unrecognised policy rather than one of the values it does know —
// see [MamRetention.parse], which is the most important line in it.
//
// No imports, on purpose: the decision layer here is pure so the privacy
// sentences and the precedence rules can be tested without a connection, an XML
// tree or a database. The connection layer reduces a stanza to
// [MamPrefsElement] and hands it to [parseMamPrefs].

/// The wire vocabulary, in one place.

/// A caller assembling the stanza should not have to remember an element name,
/// and the names live next to the code that interprets them so the two cannot
/// drift apart.
