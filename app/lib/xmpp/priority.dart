// Publish lists: the ignore list and the priority list.
//
// Two PubSub nodes on our own account carry statements about contacts, and both
// are written by our other devices as well as by us:
//
//   * the ignore list — one item per bare JID: "do not show me this person".
//   * the priority list — one item per bare JID *and subscription state*:
//     "while we are in this state with them, they are worth this much".
//
// No Standards Track XEP covers this pair, so the namespaces below are the
// whole contract. Nothing here may be relaxed on the strength of a spec version
// that does not exist.
//
// This file is the value and decision layer only: no storage, no stanzas, no
// widgets, no imports at all. It answers the three questions the rest of the
// app asks anyway — is this contact ignored, what should the roster show for
// them, and what do we send to the server — so that the answers are decided
// once and tested, rather than re-derived per call site where a slightly
// different reading creeps in.
//
// The half that matters more is what this file refuses to claim:
//
//   * An ignore-list entry is not the blocking guarantee. `xmpp/blocking.dart`
//     is. This list is what our other devices publish, and a client that
//     treated it as its security boundary would quietly lose the protection on
//     any server that does not implement it.
//   * A priority entry never hides anybody, however well it matches.
//   * Nothing here retracts a publish-list item it has not observed.
