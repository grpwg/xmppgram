// Whether an inbound message should notify, and what a notification may say.
//
// The split this file enforces: the *policy* is here, the *mechanism* is not.
// Posting a notification is the part that changes with every Android release
// and every OEM skin — channel importance, heads-up permission, the
// POST_NOTIFICATIONS runtime prompt, a per-app battery exemption — while what
// we want said when somebody writes to us has not changed in twenty years. A
// file that mixes the two gets rewritten per platform release with the
// judgement calls buried in the middle of channel plumbing, and the judgement
// calls are the only part worth reviewing.
//
// Three of the decisions below look arbitrary and are not:
//
//   * A carbon never notifies. It is a copy of a message this user wrote,
//     arriving from another of their own devices. Notifying about it means the
//     phone buzzes for the user's own typing, which teaches them that
//     notifications are noise — and they reach for "turn them all off", which
//     is the one outcome that costs every other message too.
//
//   * A message we could not open is announced but never described. Its body is
//     empty in our store and the only text we hold is a placeholder that
//     describes *our* failure, not their message. Putting that on a lock screen
//     shows the user something true and useless; leaving the notification out
//     entirely makes them wonder whether anything arrived. So the notification
//     stands, and says only that a message arrived — see [previewText].
//
//   * A mute is not a mute if the other person may type your name into it.
//     A direct mention is the one thing in a stream the user deliberately
//     silenced that they asked to hear; swallowing it is how a user ends up
//     disabling notifications for everything. See `mentionsUser`.
//
// Every rule below is ordered, first match wins, and the order *is* the
// policy: the silencing rules come before the alert rules so that nothing can
// be un-silenced by arriving in a louder state (see the muted/archived note).

/// The line a notification shows when there is nothing honest to put there.
///
/// One constant for every such case — an undecryptable message, a body with no
/// text, a message from a blocked sender — because the wording is the security
/// property, not an implementation detail, and a second copy of the sentence
/// would be a second thing to get wrong.
///
/// States one fact and only one: something arrived. It does not say what, so it
/// cannot mislead anybody on the other side of the lock screen.
const String kNoPreviewText = 'New message';

/// reported. But it is a closed set: every decision names one of these, so a
/// silence is never unexplained.
///
/// Load-bearing: "no notification appeared" is indistinguishable from "the
/// message never arrived" unless the app can say which rule dropped it. A bug
/// that suppresses notifications for a reason nobody wrote down is
/// indistinguishable from a working mute, and gets reported as a delivery bug.

///      would mean blocking is defeated by anyone who knows the user's name.
///   2. [NotifyPolicy.carbon] — before the mention override too, because the
///      text in a carbon is text this user wrote. A self-mention is not
///      something that happened in the world.
///   3. [NotifyPolicy.reading] — they are looking at it.
///   4. [NotifyPolicy.archived] — before the mention override, and this is the
///      one asymmetry between archive and mute worth stating: archiving is a
///      claim about a *room* and muting is a claim about a *person*. A room has
///      dozens of senders the user did not choose and cannot mute one by one, so
///      the only lever is to put it away — and a mention should not turn that
///      into a stream of pings from the whole membership.
///   5. [NotifyPolicy.muted] — unless [mentionsUser].
///   6. [NotifyPolicy.appInForeground] — before the undecryptable rule,
///      because "the app is open" is about the phone and "we could not open the
///      message" is about the message. The foreground wins, or the user is told
///      about a message sitting in the conversation they are looking at.
///   7. [NotifyPolicy.undecryptable] — announce, never describe.
///   8. Otherwise notify.
///
/// Every decision that alerts also counts as unread, because the badge is not a
/// notification: it is the only record that a message is waiting, and one that
/// buzzes while showing no badge reads as read. The reasons that suppress it are
/// exactly the ones `_acceptInbound` returns early for, so the badge and the
