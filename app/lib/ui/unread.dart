// The unread boundary in a conversation.
//
// Everything here is about one decision: where exactly does "you have read up
// to here" end? It is tempting to use the unread *count* — 3 unread means the
// divider goes above the third-from-last message — but the count is a number of
// arrivals, not a position, and it is wrong in ways that are invisible until
// the wrong line is drawn:
//
//   * A MAM import can add old messages at any time, so the count and the
//     position drift apart.
//   * A message that could not be decrypted still counts as unread, but it
//     renders as a system row rather than a bubble, so "three rows above the
//     divider" is not the third-from-last bubble.
//   * Reading on another device moves the boundary without changing any count
//     we can see.
//
// So the boundary is a timestamp — the read marker — and the divider goes above
// the first message after it. That is derived from what actually happened rather
// than from a tally.

///   * everything here was already read — no boundary;
///   * the read marker is newer than every message we hold, which happens after
///     reading on another device. Drawing a divider here would put a line across
