// Group chats (XEP-0045).
//
// A room is identified by the bare JID `room@server` plus our join nick
// (`room@server/nick` in presence). Almost every decision follows from that:
//
//   * Join / leave presence goes to `room@server/ourNick`.
//   * Outgoing group messages go to the *bare* room with `type='groupchat'`
//     (XEP-0045 / Conversations). Private occupant PMs use `type='chat'` to
//     `room@server/theirNick`.
//   * The sender of an incoming message is the *nick* (resource), not the room.
//   * Occupants change without notice. Anything computed once at join time — a
//     device list, a track decision — is stale by the time it is used, so
//     nothing here is cached beyond what the presence stream itself says.
//   * A room is never a roster contact: no subscription, no PEP-as-peer.
//
// On encryption, the honest position: a room's recipient set is "whoever is in
// it right now", and that set cannot be established at the moment a message is
// sent. So the post-quantum track is **not offered** for rooms. Standard OMEMO
// is, addressed at the occupants' published devices — and when that cannot be
// established, the room falls back to the same refuse-and-explain path a 1:1
// conversation uses. Silently sending a room message in the clear because the
// occupant list was momentarily unreadable would be the worst possible outcome
// for a room, where the audience is a group.
