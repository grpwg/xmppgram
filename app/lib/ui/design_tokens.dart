// The design token set.
//
// ## PROVENANCE — read before trusting a number in here
//
// These values are **principled defaults, not extracted from any reference
// project.** An attempt was made to read them from the Forkgram source
// (Telegram-Android fork) and it could not be done from this environment:
// `git clone`, `git ls-remote`, the GitHub API, `raw.githubusercontent.com` and
// an independent browser egress all returned 404 for every repository not owned
// by this account, including `TelegramMessenger/Telegram-Android`, which
// unquestionably exists. That is egress filtering, not a wrong URL.
//
// So this file deliberately encodes *approach* rather than *measurements*:
// Material 3's colour roles, its type scale and its shape scale, tuned dark
// first. Every number is defensible from first principles and none of it is
// claimed to be anybody's. When the reference becomes reachable, replace the
// values and delete this section — do not leave both, and do not describe
// values that were never measured as if they had been.
//
// ## Why a separate file
//
// Sixteen files reference the old token names. Keeping the new set in its own
// file means the rename is one mechanical pass at integration time rather than
// sixteen concurrent edits — and sixteen concurrent edits to files that other
// work is patching is exactly how a merge becomes unrecoverable.
//
// ## Why these roles and not the previous ones
//
// The previous palette sampled Telegram Android's `ThemeColors.java` field by
// field and, deliberately, avoided Telegram's own blue "so the apps are not
// confusable". That reasoning does not survive a decision to look like a
// Telegram client: if the target *is* Telegram-like, avoiding its blue buys
// nothing and costs recognisability. So the accent is now free to be
// recognisable, and the one thing that must stay distinct is the track badge
// colours — those carry meaning, not decoration.
