// wrong, which for this module cuts both ways. Three tests below are about the
// phone going buzz when it must not: a buzz for the user's own carbon, a buzz
// for someone they blocked, a buzz for a mute they set. Three more are about
// the phone staying quiet when it must speak up, because that is the failure
// that costs a user permanently rather than annoyingly — a client that drops
// the one message you needed is a client you uninstall.
//
// The sweeps are exhaustive over the nine boolean inputs on purpose. These
// rules interact, and an interaction is exactly what a hand-written table of
