// Edit history: the text a message had before it was corrected (XEP-0308).
//
// The register is restraint and failure modes. Storing the previous text is the
// easy half; the questions that decide whether this module is honest are the
// three it is built around:
//
//   * Once the bound is passed, does the history *say* that the original is
//     gone, or does it promote the oldest survivor to "the original"?
//   * After a retraction (XEP-0424), can one word of the deleted text be read
//     back by any route — including the sender un-deleting the message by
//     correcting it?
//   * Is a history that was cleared told apart from a message whose original
//     really was empty? Both end in an empty string, and only one of them means
//     we threw something away.
