// Noticing that a contact's capabilities changed, without acting on it
// (docs/10 §8).
//
// The rule: **never change the setting.** A client's messages silently
// switching between PO and OM for the same person looks like a bug, and the
// user has no way to tell whether their choice was overridden or the other
// party changed. So this only ever produces a piece of advice, and the UI
// decides when to show it.
//
// Two directions, handled differently on purpose:
//
//   * Up   — PQ became possible. Worth a quiet, dismissible banner. The user
//            asked for OM and OM works; nothing is broken.
//   * Down — a device disappeared. Not quiet: the chosen track may now
//            produce nothing at all, which is the one case where a hint that
//            can be missed turns into a message the user believes was sent.
