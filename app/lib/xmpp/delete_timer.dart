// "Delete messages after": automatic expiry of local history, per conversation
// or for the whole account.
//
// The one thing this feature is not, and the reason several rules below look
// stricter than the interface that exposes them: **it deletes from this device
// only**. Nothing here retracts. The other party's client is never told, their
// copy is untouched, and anything the server still holds (XEP-0313) is stored
// again on the next history fetch. So the only promise this feature can make is
// "not on this device right now" — never "gone" — and every screen that offers
// it has to say exactly that. A user who believes the messages no longer exist
// anywhere is *less* careful about what they type next, not more.
//
// The corollary is the second decision here: a sweep must never retract. The
// timer is a standing instruction given once, in the abstract, and the sweep
// that carries it out runs with nobody watching. Turning that into a burst of
// XEP-0424 broadcasts would tell every recipient that messages were deleted —
// by us, for a reason they were never asked about — and it would race the
// user's own manual retractions, so "deleted" messages would reappear.
//
// Three more things this file refuses to do, each of which looks like an
// omission until you picture the failure:
//
//   * **It never deletes a message that arrived before the timer was switched
//     on.** Not after a grace period — never. See [isEligibleForDeletion].
//   * **It never deletes outgoing messages** unless the caller explicitly opts
//     out. See [isEligibleForDeletion].
//   * **It never touches `plaintext_ack:<chat>`.** See below.
//
// On pins: pinning is an explicit statement about one specific message;
// a timer is a blanket rule the user set once and forgot. The specific beats
// the general, so a pin is an exemption and not merely a delay. Unpinning does
// not restore the exemption's *effect*: the message becomes eligible again on
// the next sweep, because a pin that outlives its row would be a promise about
// nothing and the UI would be claiming to protect history it has thrown away.
//
// On `plaintext_ack:<chat>` (the meta row that records "the user has agreed to
// send in the clear here"): a sweep writes no meta rows at all. Neither
// direction. Clearing it re-arms the plaintext warning once per interval, and
// under the 30-second interval that is once per message — which is precisely
// the failure the existing acknowledgement rule was written to avoid, where a
// warning repeated this often stops being read. Setting it from a row that was
// just deleted would grant consent for messages the user never saw. The
// acknowledgement is about the *track*, not about the history, and history is
// not what anybody consented to. For the same reason the draft is exempt: a
// draft is unsent plaintext the user is holding right now, it lives in
// `draft:<chat>` rather than in `messages`, and a sweep has no business
// reading or cleaning it up.

  // **changing** the interval safe, and it only does that if the caller
  // refreshes it on every change — see `setDeleteInterval`.
  //
  // The failure it prevents is worth stating because it is not obvious until
  // you say it aloud: a user has a week-long timer and has read three months
  // of history, then shortens the interval to thirty seconds because they now
  // want fast expiry. Those three-month-old messages were never eligible under
  // a week — and after the change they are. Without a refreshed arming instant
  // the very next sweep deletes months of conversation the user has already
  // read, irreversibly, triggered by a settings change that reads as
  // innocuous. There is no undo for a bulk delete.
  //
  // A grace period does not fix it either: it only postpones the deletion, and
  // the user watches the transcript change underneath them with even less
  // context for why.
  //
  // The cost, stated plainly: shortening the interval does not shorten anything
  // already on disk. Messages that arrived after the change age out on the new
  // schedule; everything older waits for its own timer. That is the only
  // reading under which changing a setting cannot destroy data the user did
  // not choose to destroy.
  //
  // Note what this does *not* say: a message that arrived *after* arming is
  // fully subject to the current interval, even if it arrived while a longer
  // one was in force. Reading it the other way would make the feature delete
  // nothing at all.

  // have stored it, and the server's archive may have expired. So deleting it
  // protects nobody and can destroy the only copy there is.
  //
  // The two failure directions are not symmetric, which is the whole argument:
  // keeping one too long leaves text on a device the user controls and has
  // already expressed an opinion about, while deleting one too early is
