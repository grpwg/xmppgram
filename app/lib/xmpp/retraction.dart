// Retracting a message for everyone (XEP-0424), and correcting one
// (XEP-0308).
//
// The two share a shape — "a later instruction about an earlier message" —
// and differ in one way that decides everything about how they travel:
//
//   * A retraction is **metadata**. It says "this message is gone"; the
//     recipient's client has to be able to act on it, and it must work
//     whether or not it can decrypt. So it goes out in the clear, carrying a
//     fallback body for clients that show something anyway.
//   * A correction **is** the new content. Encrypting it is the whole point —
//     a correction that leaks the corrected text to the server would be worse
//     than no correction. So it goes out through the ordinary encrypted path.
//
// Both address a message by its origin-id (XEP-0359). Neither may be applied
// to a message we cannot identify: an instruction naming an id we do not hold
// is either out of order or aimed at someone else's copy, and acting on it
// anyway would let one sender blank a stranger's message.
