// A room is addressed as `room@server/nick`, and almost every decision here
// follows from that one fact:
//
//   * Outgoing messages go to `room@server/ourNick`, not to the bare room. A
//     message addressed to the room goes to nobody in particular and many
//     servers drop it.
//   * The sender of an incoming message is the *nick*, not the room. Showing
//     `room@server/nick` in a bubble makes the room unreadable, and the bare
//     room says nothing about who spoke.
//   * Occupants change without notice. Anything computed once at join time — a
//     device list, a track decision — is stale by the time it is used, so
//     nothing here is cached beyond what the presence stream itself says.
//
// On encryption, the honest position: a room's recipient set is "whoever is in
// it right now", and that set cannot be established at the moment a message is
// sent. So the post-quantum track is **not offered** for rooms. Standard OMEMO
// is, addressed at the occupants' published devices — and when that cannot be
// established, the room falls back to the same refuse-and-explain path a 1:1
// conversation uses. Silently sending a room message in the clear because the
// occupant list was momentarily unreadable would be the worst possible outcome
// for a room, where the audience is a group.
