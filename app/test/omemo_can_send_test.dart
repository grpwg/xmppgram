// Whether an outgoing OMEMO stanza may be sent.
//
// This lives in `app/test/` rather than only in the package's own suite for one
// reason: `dart test` inside `packages/omemo_dart` has to resolve dependencies
// from pub.dev, and this environment's egress blocks it, so a test written only
// there would never run and therefore never guard anything. The app resolves the
// package from a path, so this one actually executes.
//
// It reaches into the package's `src/` on purpose. That is not the tidy import
// for a published package, and it is the right one here: the rule under test is
// the guarantee we make about an outgoing message, and exposing it through the
// package's public API purely so a test can name it would widen the API surface
// to serve the test rather than the caller.
