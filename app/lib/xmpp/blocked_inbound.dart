// Why this has to be a stanza handler rather than a check inside our own
// message-handling code: by the time a `MessageEvent` reaches us, moxxmpp's
// OMEMO manager has **already decrypted** the message. A check there would be
// checking after reading the letter — the keys were used, the plaintext
// existed, and no amount of not-showing-it undoes that.
//
// So this sits in the incoming *pre*-stanza phase, ahead of the OMEMO handler,
// and cancels the stanza. Cancelling alone is not enough: `cancel` stops the
// remaining pre-handlers, but the incoming handlers still run and would emit a
// MessageEvent for a message nobody decrypted. `skip` is what actually stops
// the message from being built at all.
