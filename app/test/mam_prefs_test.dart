// How much of the user's history the *server* is allowed to keep
// (XEP-0414, `urn:xmpp:mam:prefs:0`).
//
// This is the only setting in the client that is about somebody else's copy of
// the messages, so the register of these tests is the posture the module
// *refuses* to take, not the one it implements. Three failures are worth more
// here than a green suite:
//
//   * "the server did not say" collapsing into "keep everything", so a summary
//     says "kept forever" about an archive nobody has checked;
//   * a day cap that does not survive the round trip, leaving the setting
//     looking set while the number the user chose is gone;
//   * a change that shortens retention going unannounced, which teaches the
//     opposite lesson from the one the module's own warning exists to teach.
//
// The sweeps are exhaustive over the reachable state space (42
// [RetentionPolicy] values, 1764 ordered pairs) wherever the space is small
// enough to enumerate. A predicate that is only spot-checked fails on exactly
// the combination nobody wrote a case for, and the pairs nobody wrote a case
// for are where the module's two rules about *unknown* meet each other.
//
// Six assertions below are believed correct and contradict the module as
// written. They are marked FINDING and are left failing rather than weakened to
// match the code. Five defects, in six tests — one defect is asserted both by a
// named case and by an exhaustive sweep:
//
//   1. `appliesToResource` accepts a resource-scoped answer as the account's
//      picture, which is the reporting-one-device-as-another failure the
//      function's own comment names;
//   2. `shortensRetention` cannot rank a cap-only state against `never`, so the
//      most restrictive change in the protocol says nothing at all;
//   3. `shortensRetention` ranks a current that carries *no readable
//      information* against a stated cap, and `warningsBeforeChange` then
//      reports the change as a shortening instead of offering the
//      "we do not know" warning that exists for exactly this position
//      (two tests: one swept over every pair, one named);
//   4. `conversationPrivacySummary` is byte-identical to `privacySummary`
//      whenever the account default stated no recognisable policy, so a user in
//      that conversation cannot tell whose answer they are reading;
//   5. a `<with jid='  '/>` is kept rather than dropped, though it names no
//      conversation any more than an empty one does.
