// Replies to a specific message (XEP-0461).
//
// The mechanism has two halves that carry very different weight:
//
//   * The XEP-0461 `<reply>` element, which points at the target's origin-id.
//     It is metadata and goes in the clear, like reactions and retractions —
//     the recipient's client has to be able to line the reply up with what it
//     is replying to.
//   * The quoted text itself, in a `> `-prefixed fallback body, because that is
//     what every client shows and what a plain-text reader can still read.
//
// The fallback is **also** how a reply can be read by something that knows
// nothing about XEPs, and that is not a concession: it is the reason the
// fallback exists. But it must not be the only source of the quote here — the
// body is copied onto the stored row, because the quoted message is exactly
// the thing most likely to disappear (a retraction is one tap away), and a
// quote that empties out when its target is deleted is a broken quote.
