// Bounded concurrency.
//
// The register here is *timing*, which is the awkward kind to test: these tests
// must not be flaky, and a test for a concurrency bug that only fails under load
// is a test that will fail in CI once and never again. So every case below is
// written to distinguish "the runner is wrong" from "the machine is busy" by
// checking the *invariant* rather than the wall clock — peak concurrency, ordering,
// and completion — and by using zero-delay futures wherever the schedule itself
// is what is under test.
