// Bounded concurrency, as a value.
//
// Why this is its own file and not a private helper: a concurrency primitive is
// where a bug hides *quietly*. A too-low limit is slow, a too-high limit is rude,
// and one that leaks a rejection takes down the batch that was merely waiting on
// it — none of which announce themselves. Being unable to name it from a test is
// what makes those failures permanent rather than transient.

/// Runs [action] over every element of [items], at most [limit] at a time.
///
/// For work whose results are unioned rather than ordered: completion order is
/// whatever order the futures finish in, so a caller that needs its results in
/// input order must sort them itself. That restriction is the reason this does
/// not return a list — a returned list would invite a caller to believe in an
/// order it does not have.
///
/// An exception from one element does not cancel the rest. The use this was
/// written for is fetching one peer's device bundles, where one unreadable
/// bundle is a normal thing that happens and the other thirty-nine devices are
/// still perfectly reachable. Letting a single rejection propagate would
/// discard every device that had already answered, which is a strictly worse
/// outcome than losing the one that failed.
///
/// [limit] below one is treated as one. A zero or negative cap with the obvious
/// implementation deadlocks or silently drops everything, and neither is worth
/// the flexibility.

/// version cannot fail when the limit stops working. A measurement that cannot
/// detect the bug it exists to detect is worse than none, because it reads as
