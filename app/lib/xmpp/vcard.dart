// Contact cards — XEP-0054, vCard-temp / RFC 2426.
//
// The card a contact publishes about themselves, and the only place a name
// that is not a JID comes from. This file is the value and decision layer for
// it: parsing, field extraction, and the rule for what to call somebody. No
// network, no storage, no widgets — the layers above decide when to fetch and
// where to draw it.
//
// Everything here operates on text written by a client we do not control, and
// most of that text ends up rendered next to a person's messages. Three
// decisions carry the file, and all three are about what to *believe* rather
// than how to parse:
//
//   * Strict about what we accept, lenient about what we reject. One
//     unreadable field must never cost us the name sitting beside it, and a
//     malformed card must never take the profile page down with it.
//   * A missing field means "the publisher did not tell us", and nothing in
//     this file may conclude anything stronger than that from it.
//   * Nothing reaches a widget without passing a sanitiser, because a
//     zero-width joiner in somebody's name is an ordinary accident and an RTL
//     override in it is not.

/// the complaint that produces the feature request "let me choose my name".
///
/// FN beats a reconstructed `N`, even though the reconstruction is built to
/// look exactly like an FN would. FN is the publisher's own resolution of
/// exactly the question we cannot answer — in which order this person writes
/// their name. Preferring our reconstruction means a contact with both can be
/// rendered two ways in the same app: the chat list uses `FN` somewhere else
/// and the profile uses `Wei Chen` from `N`, and the user is looking at one
/// person.
///
/// ORG is never the answer, and this is the decision most likely to be got
/// wrong by putting it in as a last resort before the JID. An organisation in
/// the title slot of a 1:1 conversation reads as "this chat is with a company",
/// which is false, and on a domain with a shared address the same string appears
/// on every contact — so the one field that could have disambiguated them is
/// the field that makes them indistinguishable. [VCard.organisation] is exposed
/// for the profile page, where "works at" is a true and useful thing to say.

/// contact cannot get wrong: it is the address the messages actually arrive
/// from, and a name that is wrong is worse than an address that is ugly.
///
/// This knows nothing about the roster's own `name` for the contact. Which of

///
/// Strict on values: unknown elements are ignored rather than treated as
/// fields, a `BINVAL` that is not base64 is dropped rather than stored, and a
/// photo that is not an image is dropped rather than decoded. Strictness here
/// is free, because a wrong value costs one field.
///
/// Lenient everywhere a strict reading would cost the whole card: a property
/// name in the wrong case, an `N` with three components instead of five, a
/// duplicate `FN`, markup inside a value, a `vCard` in the wrong namespace, an
/// element from a namespace we have never heard of, a card with nothing in it
/// at all. None of those throw, and none of them discard the `FN` sitting next
/// to them. This data comes from a client we do not control and it ends up
/// rendered in our UI, so the cost of a throw is somebody's profile page
/// failing to open over a stray capital letter, and the cost of leniency is at
/// worst one slightly odd string in one list row.
///
/// The one place leniency stops is a property's *parameters*. `<TYPE>`,
/// `<PREF>` and `<ENCODING>` are children of the property that carries them,
/// so reading a value as "all the text underneath" would concatenate them into
/// the value: a card with `<TEL><TYPE>pref</TYPE>+441234</TEL>` would put the
/// phone number through as "pref+441234". [\_ownText] is why that does not
