// client thinks is best" — the one that was asked for, or nothing is sent.
//
// The reason is that every substitution is silent to the person whose
// conversation it is. The message still arrives, it just arrives readable,
// and the reader has no way to tell. A client that quietly downgrades is
// worse than one that refuses.
