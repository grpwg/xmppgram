// Message bookmarks (XEP-0333, PEP Native Bookmarks).
//
// A bookmark answers one question: which conversations do I want to be in when
// I open this app. It lives on the user's own server, so it is the only part of
// this client's state that is shared with the user's *other* devices rather
// than merely cached on this one.
//
// Three consequences, and every decision below follows from one of them:
//
//   * The list is published **whole**. XEP-0333 keeps every bookmark inside a
//     single PubSub item (`storage:bookmarks`, item `current`) rather than one
//     item each, so there is no "publish one room" and no retract-to-delete —
//     a removal is a republish without that entry. That is why this module
//     computes a *plan* and the caller turns it into exactly one stanza.
//   * The list belongs to the user, not to us. A diff that believes it knows
//     the whole list can delete every room they have, and the one time it does
//     that is the time it was wrong: a reinstall, before the server's copy has
//     been read. Hence [BookmarkIntent], which makes "I know the whole list" an
//     assertion the caller has to state.
//   * Bookmarks arrive from clients that are not us and carry fields we have
//     not modelled. Rewriting one must not drop them — and must not be *caused*
//     by them either, or two devices republish the same room at each other for
//     as long as both are signed in.
