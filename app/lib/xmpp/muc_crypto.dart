// Who a group-chat message is encrypted *to* (docs/10 §6).
//
// muc.dart answers "can a room message be delivered". This file answers "to
// whom, and with what guarantee" — the question muc.dart's `resolveRoomTrack`
// answers with a bare device count, which is why it stops one step short.
//
// The invariant, carried over from track_resolver.dart unchanged in shape:
//
//   * never silently substitute a weaker track,
//   * never send plaintext because a lookup was slow,
//   * never report a protection the message does not have.
//
// The room version *is* weaker, and says so rather than hiding it. A 1:1
// conversation needs every device of the one recipient, because a single
// unreadable device means somebody's second phone does not get the message.
// A room cannot work that way: any room containing one person with OMEMO
// switched off would be permanently unsendable, which is most rooms. So a
// room message is encrypted for the occupants who can open it, and the rest
// see ciphertext. That is a real difference in what the two guarantees mean,
// and the UI has to be able to state which one it has — hence
// `unreadableOccupants` rather than a boolean.
//
// What is *not* relaxed: the room's track is never chosen on the user's
// behalf, and a partial or stale roster blocks exactly as an unreadable
// device list blocks for 1:1. PQ is offered for private non-anonymous rooms
// when every member is fully PQ-capable (checked at send time).
