/// asked for capabilities: `capabilityServiceProvider` resolves its managers
/// through `dualTrackManagerProvider`, and that provider depended on the
/// wiring provider, which depended on `capabilityServiceProvider` again.

/// real device, invisible to unit tests because they never build two
/// providers that reference each other through a lazy callback.

/// Keeping it in the tree also makes the lifetime obvious: the wiring is
/// attached while a widget is mounted and removed when it goes away.
