// The account this device last logged in with, and its password.
//
// ## Why the password is stored at all
//
// Not for convenience. Because the alternative is what this app was doing: a
// cold start, or any dropped socket, lands on an empty login form and asks the
// user to retype a password they cannot read from the screen. Every reconnect
// became a manual task, which means a client that cannot be left running is a
// client that is not actually a client.
//
// ## Why it is acceptable
//
// XMPP has no token: the credential *is* the password, and every message client
// that keeps you logged in keeps it. So the question is not "may it be stored"
// but "where", and the answer is the platform keystore via
// `FlutterSecureStorage` — the same store already used for the database
// passphrase and the OMEMO keys. Nothing here is written to the database, to
// preferences, or to a file, so it does not travel with a backup of anything
// else.
//
// ## What is deliberately absent
//
// No "remember me" flag and no account switcher. One account is what this build
// supports, and a flag that can be off while the password is still on disk
// would be a lie in one direction or the other.
