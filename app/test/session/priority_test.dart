// Almost every test here is about restraint rather than coverage. Three ways
// this module can be wrong all look like working software:
//
//   * an empty list, or one we could not read, that reads as "ignore
//     everybody";
//   * a priority entry that hides a contact once their subscription state
//     moves on, so the one conversation the user just fixed is the one that
//     vanishes;
//   * a patch that retracts a publish-list item nobody observed, deleting an
//     entry another of our own devices had just written.
