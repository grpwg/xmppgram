// kind a PQ message reaches the UI as the literal fallback body — "This
// message is encrypted. Use a supported client to read it." — with no error
// attached, which is indistinguishable from a successful delivery.

// The handler sits *before* the standard handlers and does the one thing they
// cannot: swap the B-track ciphertext for the plaintext body. Everything
// downstream (EME reading, carbon handling, MAM, storage) then works exactly
// as it does for the A track, because by the time it runs there is only one
