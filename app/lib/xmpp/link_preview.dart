// Link previews: the out-of-band data a sender attached (XEP-0385), the link
// found in the message text, and the rules that decide whether this device may
// act on either of them.
//
// The rules are here and the fetching is not, and that split is structural
// rather than a matter of discipline: `PreviewAllowed` has a private constructor
// and the only thing that mints one is `LinkPreviewPolicy.mayFetch`. There is no
// value in this program that a caller can build, copy out of one message and
// replay against another, so a request cannot be made from here without having
// been through the policy first.
//
// Why a preview deserves that much machinery. Fetching one is a request this
// device makes, from the user's phone, to a host that the *sender* chose, on a
// schedule the sender picked, and nothing in a message bubble says a request went
// out. That is the same shape as the two things this client already refuses to
// do quietly — substituting a weaker encryption track, and acting for somebody
// the user blocked — so the same rule applies: the choice is the user's, it is
// made where they can see it, and every refusal names the rule behind it.
//
// What moxxmpp hands us today is the XEP-0066 `<x xmlns='jabber:x:oob'/>`
// element: a URL and a description, nothing else. XEP-0385's `<reference>` carries
// more — a media type, a size, a thumbnail — and none of that arrives yet, so
// `OutOfBandData` holds the fields that may be present and refuses the rest
// rather than inventing them.
//
// Depends on nothing outside `dart:`. The rules are the part worth reviewing, and
// a reviewer should not have to hold an XMPP stack in their head to read them —
// or an emulator to run the tests.

///     for. A link the body carried is authenticated by the encryption; a link
///     that only the element carried is not, and this file refuses to act on
///     unauthenticated claims in the one place where acting on them is invisible.
///
///   * A title or description that was sent for a *different* address is the most
///     valuable thing anybody can put in a preview: it is the text that will read
///     like our own words about their link. So the enrichment is dropped rather
///     than pinned next to a link it was not written for, and the disagreement

/// validation would be trusting whoever called it.
