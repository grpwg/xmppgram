// Message reactions (XEP-0444).
//
// Reactions are metadata about a message, not a message. That single fact
// drives every decision in this file:
//
//   * They go out **unencrypted**. Wrapping a reaction in OMEMO hides it from
//     every client that is not us, so the sender's other devices — and
//     Conversations, and Signal — would never see it. A reaction the other
//     person cannot see is not a reaction.
//   * They reference the target by its **origin-id** (XEP-0359), because that
//     is the id that survives archiving and replay.
//   * A broadcast is a reactor's **complete** set, not a delta. Emptying the
//     list is how someone takes a reaction back, so the receiver has to
//     replace rather than merge.
