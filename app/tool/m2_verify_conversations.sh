# M2 acceptance: does a real Conversations install display a message we
# encrypted?
#
# Why a script and not just a test: the proof lives in the *other* app. This
# sends one uniquely marked, standard-OMEMO message from our client and then
# reads Conversations' own view hierarchy looking for the marker. A passing
# run therefore means Conversations parsed our bundle, built a session with
# us and decrypted our ciphertext — nothing else can produce that.
#
# The direction is deliberate. Of the two accounts, conversations.im refuses
# stanzas that are not inside a mutual subscription ("auth/forbidden: Access
# denied by service policy"), so a message from conversations.im never
# reaches Conversations on jabber.fr. The reverse direction works, and
# Conversations still has to decrypt it.
#
# Usage:
#   tool/m2_verify_conversations.sh <ourJid> <ourPass> <peerJid>
