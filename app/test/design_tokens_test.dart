// These tests are about **legibility**, because that is the property of a colour
// set that actually fails in the field. A palette that looks fine in a design
// review is routinely unreadable on a cheap panel in sunlight, and a chat
// transcript where you cannot read the timestamp is a chat transcript you will
// get support requests about.
//
// The contrast thresholds are WCAG 2.1: 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large
// text and for non-text UI that carries meaning (a badge, an icon). Both are
// checked here so a future palette edit cannot silently regress them.
