// Blocking a contact (XEP-0191).
//
// The reason this file exists is one sentence: **blocking stops us from acting
// as a reader and a signer for someone, and nothing else does.** The server
// still routes their messages. So the guarantee we can make is narrow and we
// should make exactly that one, rather than a broader one we cannot keep.
//
// Three consequences, each of which is a place a messenger gets it wrong:
//
//   * We do not decrypt their messages. Decrypting is the whole point of
//     holding the keys; a "blocked" client that quietly opens everything is
//     worse than one that shows nothing.
//   * We do not acknowledge them. No delivery receipt, no read marker, no
//     auto-reply. Each one is a signal that says "this person has an active
//     reader", and an acknowledgement is exactly what a blocked sender is
//     trying not to get.
//   * We do not send to them unless the user overrides it. Blocking and
//     sending are separate acts; a user who opens a blocked conversation and
//     types must be allowed to, because refusing silently is its own kind of
//     lie.
