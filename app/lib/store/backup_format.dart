// What a backup is, and — more to the point — what it may never contain.
//
// The decision this file exists to hold in place: **OMEMO key material never
// leaves the device.** The sealed identity key under `OmemoDeviceStore` opens
// every message this account has ever sent or received. A backup containing it
// is not a copy of the user's data; it is a plaintext, unrevocable,
// indefinitely-lived decryption capability in a file whose entire purpose is to
// be copied off the phone — emailed to a new handset, put in a cloud folder,
// left on a lost device's card. Nothing the user can do later takes it back,
// because the keystore key that would re-protect it never travels with it.
//
// So the exclusion here is structural rather than a default. [Secret] is a
// type; [BackupValue] is a sealed type that [Secret] is not a member of; every
// function that writes an archive takes [BackupValue]. There is no "include
// keys" flag to set, and no code path — present or future — that can put key
// material into an archive, because the encoder has no parameter that could
// accept one. [cellFromJson] is the single door that takes an untyped value,
// because a decoded file is `Object?` all the way down, and it refuses a
// [Secret] by name.
//
// What a backup *does* contain is plaintext message text, exactly as sensitive
// as the message it copies, and protected by exactly what protects the
// database it came from. This format does not encrypt the archive: the file
// goes wherever the user sends it, and adding a second secret to it would only
// mean one more thing the user cannot revoke. The trust being asked for is
// narrow and worth stating plainly — "this is your history; it is not readable
// by anyone who cannot open your database" — rather than dressed up with a
// checksum that is not, and never was, protection against a reader.
//
// JSON, all the way down, including the framing. A backup is a file a person
// may keep for years and may need to read after several app versions, possibly
// after the app is gone: a layout only this build understands is a layout that
// becomes unrecoverable the moment we stop shipping. Text also means the user
// can open it and *see* that it holds conversations and no keys, which is the
// only way that claim is checkable by anybody but us.
//
// Not in this file: reading or writing files, the document picker, the queries
// that produce rows, and the inserts that consume them. This is the layer those
// three have to agree on.
