// Three decisions in here are not obvious, and each is argued where it is made:
//
//   * A sticker is **content**, so it travels inside the encrypted payload.
//     That is the opposite of how this app treats a reaction, and the reason is
//     not "encryption is good". See stickerSendShape.
//   * A declared media type is evidence, not proof. See StickerSafety.check.
//   * A sticker with no integrity hash is not cacheable, and that has nothing
//     to do with whether it is safe to look at. See StickerItem.integrity.
