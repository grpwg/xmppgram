// Every test below asks one question: what is the worst thing that follows if
// this is wrong? For a module whose job is to describe a file, that is always
// one of two — we leak key material into a file the user sends to themselves,
// or we destroy a year of their history by accepting a file that is not whole.
// So the tests are about those two, and about the third thing that is easier to
// get wrong: telling the user "this file is corrupt" when it is not, which is
// the same as having no backup.
