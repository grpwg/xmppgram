//
// The decision these tests protect is the one that looks like a limitation: a
// forward is a *new, re-encrypted* message, not the original stanza wrapped in
// XEP-0297's `<forwarded/>`.
//
// Reusing the stanza would carry encryption meant for the original recipient.
// The new recipient would get a blob they cannot open, and the wrapper's
// metadata would still name the original recipient. So the original ciphertext
// is deliberately not re-sent, and these tests say so rather than leaving it to
// be rediscovered as a missing feature.
