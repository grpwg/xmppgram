// Local nicknames: the name *this user* gives somebody, with nothing sent to
// anybody and nothing asked of anybody.
//
// The name on the other side of a chat is not always the name the user thinks
// of that person by, and there is no standard way to fix that — which is
// exactly why this is a local feature, and why its storage has to be defensive.
//
// Three decisions carry the file:
//
//   * **What a nickname may contain.** It is drawn in a one-line row, so a
//     character that draws nothing is not a cosmetic detail. "Bob" and "Bob"
//     with a zero-width space on the end are two different names that look
//     identical on screen, which is a collision the user cannot see and so
//     cannot resolve.
//   * **What the stored form guarantees.** It is an opaque string in a row that
//     a later build owns. A value this build cannot read must cost a nickname,
//     never a conversation.
//   * **Whose name a given string is.** A room's title and a person's name in
//     that room are different questions, and the second one has a
//     catastrophically wrong answer available to the first.
//
// Deliberately imports nothing. This is the only place that decides what a
// nickname may be, so neither storage nor UI gets a vote in it.

/// A name the user chose for a person, guaranteed renderable and trimmed.
///
/// Absent means null, not a value: a `LocalNickname.none` would have to be
/// checked at every use, and could still be stored by accident.
///
/// The constructor is private on purpose. A `LocalNickname` in existence is one
/// that passed [tryParse], so the chat row, the avatar and the mention do not
/// each re-decide what a nickname may contain — and therefore cannot disagree
/// about it.

  /// [String.trim] does not only take spaces: it takes every character Unicode
  /// calls whitespace, and U+FEFF, which is the tab and the next-line control
  /// and the byte order mark as well. Trimming first would remove those before
  /// the loop below ever saw them, and hand back a nickname the rules refuse:
  /// "Alex" with a byte order mark in front of it would come out as "Alex",
  /// and "Bob" with a tab after it as "Bob". A name that arrives carrying a
  /// character that draws nothing is refused with that character still in it,
  /// wherever in the name it was.
  ///
  /// The rules, in the order they are applied:
  ///
  /// * **Nothing that draws nothing is allowed, padding included.** A newline in
  ///   a one-line row is a broken layout; a NUL in a row is a truncated string;
  ///   a soft hyphen is drawn by nothing at all. The zero-width family is the
  ///   dangerous half: it survives a copy and a paste, it is invisible in every
  ///   place the user can check, and it makes two names that look the same
  ///   compare as different. Bidi controls are refused for the sharper version
  ///   of the same reason — an override can render "Bob" as something else
  ///   entirely.
  /// * **Trimmed, not refused.** Padding is a habit rather than a mistake, and
  ///   rejecting a name the user can plainly see in the field would leave them
  ///   hunting for the reason. Trimming also makes the stored string, the drawn
  ///   string and the string compared for collisions the same string, which is
  ///   what stops " Bob" and "Bob" from being two entries in one list. Spaces
  ///   are padding; a tab is a character, and the rule above has already had it.
  /// * **A name that is nothing but whitespace is not a name.** It trims to
  ///   nothing, and a nickname field that accepts one produces a chat row with
  ///   a blank title — which reads as a row that failed to load.
  /// * **Capped, refused rather than truncated.** A truncated name is a
  ///   different name that the user never chose, and it can be cut in the
  ///   middle of a word or of a character the display needs a second code unit
  ///   for. There is no way to cut one safely without segmenting grapheme
  ///   clusters, so the input is refused and the caller is left to say why.
  /// * **At least one thing that draws.** The rule above is a blacklist, and a
  ///   blacklist is only as good as the next character somebody invents. So a
  ///   name also has to contain something that renders, which refuses a name
  ///   made entirely of invisible characters even if one of them slips past.

///
/// * **A name with nothing visible in it is a question mark.** Nothing else in
///   this app validates a display name, so a row whose nickname is a single
///   zero-width space is an ordinary row that loads without complaint — and
///   taking its first code point draws that character, which draws nothing, in a
///   circle that therefore looks like a spinner.
/// * **Invisible characters are skipped before the fallback too, not only
///   before the first letter.** A name of "a zero-width space and an emoji"
///   has no letter in it, so the fallback is what runs, and skipping nothing
///   there returns the invisible character instead of the emoji.
/// * **Grapheme sequences come back whole.** A ZWJ sequence, a skin-tone
///   modifier and a flag are several code points that are one picture, and the
///   first code point alone is a different picture: the man of a family, or a
///   letter in a box. This is true of a sequence that *starts* with a letter
///   too: a Devanagari conjunct is two letters and a joiner, and the first rune
///   on its own is not a thing anybody writes.
/// * **Digits and symbols are not letters, in every script on every plane.**
///   They are other general categories — `N` and `S` — so the single category
///   test above excludes "4", "५", "๕", "𝟜", "×" and "÷" together. Ranges could
///   not: those digits sit *inside* the Devanagari and Thai blocks and `×` and
///   `÷` sit *inside* Latin-1, so each one needed a hole cut for it by hand and
///   the next script needed another hand.
